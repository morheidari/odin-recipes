    <h1>Fish recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lemon Butter Fish may be more frequently ordered at restaurants than made at home. Itâ€™s not your typical Tuesday night, in-between carpool fare.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 TB melted butter (I use salted, but unsalted is fine) â€” real butter makes a huge difference in flavor
        </li>
        <li>Juice and zest from 1 medium lemon â€” avoid bottled lemon juice. If your lemon is on the larger size, use less of it.
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt, plus extra to taste</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika, for a bit of smoky flavor and natural color
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder; it serves as your weeknight time-saving aromatic
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder, same as above. 
        </li>
        <li>1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper; always use fresh peppercorns and grind your black pepper fresh. It makes a huge flavor difference. 
        </li>
        <li>3 TB olive oil; we use olive oil for most of our cooking, which feels healthier to me, as well as works really well with most recipes. We even use it in chocolate cake â€” ridiculously moist. 
        </li>
        <li>freshly chopped basil or parsley leaves, for garnish and flavor
        </li>
        <li>extra lemon slices for serving â€“ kind of a vanity thing, but fish always looks prettier with freshly sliced lemon slivers on top ðŸ™‚
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use paper towels to thoroughly pat-dry excess moisture from fish fillets â€“ this step is crucial for fish to brown nicely in pan. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine melted butter, lemon juice and zest, and 1/2 tsp kosher salt. Stir to combine well. Taste and add a bit more kosher salt, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 tsp kosher salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Evenly press spice mixture onto all sides of fish fillets.
        </li>
        <li>In a large, heavy pan over medium high heat, heat up the olive oil until hot. Once your oil is sizzling,  Cook 2 fish fillets at a time to avoid overcrowding (allows for even browning.) Cook each side just until fish becomes opaque, feels somewhat firm in the center, and is browned â€“ lightly drizzle some of the lemon butter sauce as you cook, reserving the rest for serving. Take care not to over-cook, as that will result in a tougher texture. Season with extra kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Serve fish with with remaining lemon butter sauce, basil or parsley, and lemon wedges.
        </li>
    </ol>
